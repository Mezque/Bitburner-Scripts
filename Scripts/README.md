## Hackv2.js 
based off the example hack script with extra logging and features. Place on desired target then run `run hackv2.js SERVERNAME` ex: `run hackv2.js n00dles` <br />

## OLD SCRIPTS 
These ones are not as useful as the newer stuff but I thought they should be included as well <br />
## hackv1.js 
Hack v1 will always hack server and does not wait for the server to reach a certain thresh-hold money point. This will result in faster money flow but less total gain when online <br />
## growv1.js
Does the same thing as hack v1 but grows instead of hack <br />
