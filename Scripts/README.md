## Hackv2.js 
based off the example hack script with extra logging and features. Place on desired target then run `run hackv2.js SERVERNAME` ex: `run hackv2.js n00dles` <br />

## OLD SCRIPTS 
These ones are not as useful as the newer stuff but I thought they should be included as well, granted the older hack script will result in quicker money early on but does not maximise potential gains. No wait is required for growing or weakening a server as well (as it isn't done unless grow v1 is also running). Pick your poison, personally I would go with v2 as its more ideal if you intend on leaving the game running in the background as well like I do.<br />
## hackv1.js 
Hack v1 will always hack server and does not wait for the server to reach a certain thresh-hold money point. This will result in faster money flow but less total gain when online granted this is much better for quicker money gains early on, or early on offline gains. Same can be said for grow v1 as well. Place on desired target then run `run hackv1.js SERVERNAME` ex: `run hackv1.js n00dles`<br />
## growv1.js
Does the same thing as hack v1 but grows instead of hack. Place on desired target then run `run growv1.js SERVERNAME` ex: `run growv1.js n00dles`.<br />
